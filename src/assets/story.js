            'Enrolling in a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science was like stepping into an alien world. As a former biology student who’d rather chase a ball than a bug in code, my first data structures lab was a complete shocker. I didn’t even know how to write a basic print statement in C language! But I showed up, begrudgingly, to every class. My grades took a nosedive, but somewhere between banging my head on the keyboard and surviving exams, I realized programming wasn’t so bad. College became the place where I discovered that coding is less about syntax and more about problem-solving.'

        description: 'Somehow, I landed a job at one of India’s biggest MNCs right out of college, but I wasn’t exactly jumping for joy. After all, I had never pictured myself as a developer—I was more into seeing how things worked rather than making them work. Just when I thought I’d missed the boat, my friends pitched an idea for a product, and I couldn’t resist. With dreams of becoming the cool millionaire co-founder by 25, I dove headfirst into learning everything I should’ve known already. I even built an auto-mapping feature that made our product’s accuracy soar to 98%. But then the pandemic hit, and our dreams hit a wall.',

            'After the startup dream fizzled, I hit pause and decided to dip my toes into freelancing. I taught myself how to build websites, and while my design skills were questionable at best, I could at least make them function. This was where I became a jack-of-all-trades, mastering front-end, back-end, API design, and even cloud deployment. Along the way, I also cleared the Combined Defence Services exam—only to have my parents veto the whole "battlefield" thing. With my new skill set and a reluctant thumbs-down to the army life, I figured it was time to dive back into the full-time job market.'

Initially brought on as a developer, I ended up wearing every hat possible—developer, tester, manager, you name it. This was the dream job where I had the freedom to explore all aspects of our product, from coding to data analysis. I had a blast working with data, using various technologies Redshift by Amazon, Tableau, R and even found myself drawn to the idea of specializing in this area. My managers saw the potential too and encouraged me to take the leap towards further studies in data science.',

        description: 'Armed with big dreams, I moved to the U.S. to pursue my master’s, aiming to soak up all the high-quality education the country had to offer. The first few months was a bit of a bumpy ride, but I quickly found my footing. I threw myself into mastering the latest industry tech, balancing my passion for both software engineering and data science. Not only have I kept my grades up, but I’ve also managed to stay deeply involved in both fields. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m excited about what the future holds as I continue to bridge the gap between software and data.',
