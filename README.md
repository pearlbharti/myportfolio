I need an about page in react.
import React from 'react'

function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  )
}

export default AboutPage

The page starts with title Helping you thrive
in the digital world. Josefin sans

Then a grey line underneath it after some padding

Then a container, split into two.
To the left I need written 
" I help people from all over the world with tailor-made solutions. With each project, I push my work to new horizons, always putting quality first."

On the right I need a rectangular vertical image, Which moves as I scroll.

Once that container is done, 
I need a title saying, "I can help you with "
Beneath it I need 
3 cards
1st card: Data Science
2nd Card: Development
3rd Card: Full Package

Beneath it 
I need a container split into 2.
On the left a rectangular vertical image, on the right I need Lorem ipsum text with a title. 
Beneath this is a footer <Footer/>, I've already imported this. I want it so that when you scroll past the above container, the bottom edge is curved and the footer is revealed.
The effect I'm describing is often referred to as a "curved curtain" or "curved reveal" effect.
